- The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object chnages state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern

- How it works:
    > The Subject object manages some important data.
    > The observers have subscribed to (registered with) the subject to receive updates when the subject's data changes.
    > When data in the Subject changes, the observers are notified.
    > New data vlaues are communicated to the observers in some form when they change.

- There are 2 interfaces - Subject and Observer
    > Objects uses Subject interface to register as observers and also to remove themselves from being observers.
      A concrete subject always implements the Subject interface. In addition to the register and remove methods, the concrete subject implements a notifyObservers() methods that is used to update all the current observers whenever state chnages.
      The concrete subject may also have mthods for setting and getting its state.
    > All potential observers need to implement the Observer interface. This interface has just one method, update(), that is called when the subject's state changes.
      Concrete observers can be any class that implements the Observer interface. Each observer registers with a concrete subject to receive updates.

- When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but they typically have very little knowledge of each other. The observer pattern is a great example of loose coupling.
