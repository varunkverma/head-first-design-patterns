- Design Patterns don't godirectly into your code, they first go into your BRAIN. Once you've loaded your brain with a good working knowledge of patterns, you can then start to apply them to your new designs, and rework your old code when you find it's degrading into an  inflexible mess. 

- Remember, knowing concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism doesn't make a good object-oriented designer. 
A design Guru thinks about how to create flexible designs that are maintainable and cope with change.

- When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but they typically have very little knowledge of each other. The observer pattern is a great example of loose coupling.
